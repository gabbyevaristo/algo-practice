# Description
"""
At every point, some local best is chosen. The algorithm assumes that a
local "good" selection makes for a global optimal solution.

This does not always lead to the optimal solution.

"""


# Basic properties
"""
1. Greedy choice property: the globally optimal solution can be obtained
   by making a locally optimal solution

2. Optimal substructure: if an optimal solution to the problem contains
   optimal solutions to the subproblems, the problem has an optimal
   substructure
